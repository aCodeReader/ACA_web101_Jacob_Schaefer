    <h2>What is Aquaponics??</h2>
    <p>Aquaponics is a highly sustainable method of Agriculture. <br> Where the Fish feed the plants and the plants clean the water for the fish. </p>

        <h5>Aquaponics uses 90% less water than traditional farming</h5>
        <h5>grows six times more per square foot than traditional farming.</h5>
        <h5>Aquaponics mimics the natural symbiotic relationship between fish & plants.</h5>
        <h5>Plants Grows Twice As Fast! Due to the naturally fortified water from the fish.</h5>
        <h5>Fish are the fastest converter of plant protein to animal protein.</h5>
        <h5>Low susceptibility to pests and diseases. </h5>
        <h5> Little to no Chemical usage.</h5>
    
 <a id="systems"><h2>Different Types of Systems</h2></a> 
<ol>
    <li>
        <h3>Media Filled Beds.</h3>
        <img class="mediB" src="http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5873268dbebafb70ccf1b3d5/58e57d95c534a58796ea806c/58e57f6be6f2e18039b963da/1551917580820/?format=1500w" alt="">
        <p> Media filled beds are the simplest form of aquaponics, they use containers filled with rock medium of expanded clay or similar. Water from a fish tank is pumped over the media filled beds, and plants grow in the rock media. This style of system can be run two different ways, with a continuous flow of water over the rocks, or by flooding and draining the grow bed, in a flood and drain or ebb and flow cycle.</p>

        <h3>Nutrient Film Technique (NFT)</h3>
        <img class="NFT" src="https://www.howtoaquaponic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/vertical-aquaponics-686x1024.jpg" alt="">
        <P> Nutrient Film Technique is a commonly used hydroponic method, but is not as common in aquaponic systems. In NFT systems, nutrient rich water is pumped down small enclosed gutters, the water flowing down the gutter is only a very thin film. Plants sit in small plastic cups allowing their roots to access the water and absorb the nutrients. NFT is only really suitable for certain types of plants, generally leafy green vegetables, larger plants will have root systems that are too big and invasive, or they become too heavy for the lightweight growing gutters. One adavatage is vertical intergration, which can help save valuable realestate in a greenhouse.</P>

        <h3>Deep Water Culture (DWC)</h3>
        <img class="DWC" src="https://i2.wp.com/agfundernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/aquaponics-540x350.jpg?resize=540%2C265&ssl=1" alt="">
        <p> Deep Water Culture, works on the idea of floating plants on top of the water allowing the roots to hang down into the water. This can be done in a number of ways. This method is one of the more commonly practiced commercial methods. DWC can be done by floating a foam raft on top of the fish tank, however a more common method is to grow the fish in a fish tank and pump the water through a filtration system, and then into long channels where floating rafts filled with plants float on the water surface and extract the nutrients.</p>

    <h2>Indoor, Outdoor or Green House </h2>
    <h3>Outdoor</h3>
    <p>
            Pros

            Uses the sun as light source – free light!
            No costs associated with climate control or lighting.
            
            Cons
            
            Limited number of harvests per year – the harvest season is controlled by the climate of your region.
            High water usage – can’t reclaim condensate.
            Can’t control climate or humidity levels – inconsistent climate can lead to inferior product
            Only viable in certain regions – some areas of the country either don’t allow outdoor grows or the climate in the region (too hot or too cold)  prevents them from being viable.
            Highest risk – limited protection from pests, weather.
        
</p>
<h3>Green House</h3>
<p> 
        Pros
        the sun as light source – free light.
        Ability to grow year-round – ability to semi-control the climate year-round means growing  can take place year-round.
        Cons
        
        Outside air constantly introduced – greenhouses are not sealed environments, exchanging air with the outside. This can lead to problems inside the facility, especially on humid days. Introducing outside air can also lead to the introduction of pests and pathogens.
        Climate control and humidity affected by outside conditions – climate control needs can spike in the summer and winter in order to keep inside temperature at desired levels.
        </p>
    <h3>Indoor</h3>
        <p>
                Pros
                Maximum number of harvests per year –  enclosed environment creates the ability to control the climate year-round, enabling growing to happen year-round.
                Consistent climate and light delivery – the sealed and enclosed environment means outdoor climate has minimum impact on cultivation facility, allowing for maximum control.
                No outside air exchange required – indoor facilities can be sealed, avoiding outside introduction of pests and pathogens as well as allowing for better control of climate and humidity.
                
                Cons
                
                High energy consumption – lights and cooling use a lot of electricity, leading to indoor cultivation having the highest monthly energy bill.
                High build-out cost – whether building new or renovating an existing building, the up-front costs for an indoor cultivation facility are the highest of these three options.
